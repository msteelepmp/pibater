Raspberry Pi Chicken incubator

This is Python code that attempts to control for temperature and egg rotation for incubating chickens. It will also alert if the humidity is out of range and take pictures every 15 min.

I'm running a Raspberry Pi 3 with the RPi Camera2, SunFoundery Humiture sensor and relay, and a TowerPro 9G servo

This is also my first Python project. So any hints or suggestions would be appreciated.
